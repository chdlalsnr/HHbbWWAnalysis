Questions about the DNN input variables

Low Level :
Is the l1,l2 ordering done per cone-pt ? 
In Louvain : ok for ElEl and MuMu, but for ElMu it is hardcoded that first lepton is electron and second lepton is muon
    -> I expect this might be an issue in pdgId node (l1 is by construction the electron then)

High level :
- m_bb_bregcorr : bRegCorr applied on PT and M or only PT ? In Louvain : both
- HT : only on selected Ak4 jets (and cleaning) ? 
- min_dr_jets_lep1 : jets -> same question as above
- min_dphi_jet : is there an absolute value ? If not the variable will always be negative
- m_hh_simplemet : b1+b2+l1+l2+met -> nothing else right ? 
- mww_simplemet : same, no more particles ? 
- n_btag : is this disabled for DNN 04 (without btag info) ? 

Add
- n_btag : did you train with 0btag
