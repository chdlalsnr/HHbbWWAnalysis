Thanks so much for coming here to raise an issue. Please take a moment to 'check' the below boxes:

- [ ] I'm up-to-date with the latest release:
    
      pip install -U talos

- [ ] I've confirmed that my Keras model works outside of Talos.

If you still have an error, please submit **complete trace** and a code with: 

- output of shape for x and y e.g. (212,12)
- Talos params dictionary
- The Keras model wired for Talos
- Description of extra variables in the model

You can provide the code in pastebin / gist or any other format you like.
